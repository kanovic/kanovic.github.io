## Hi, my name is Koen

Welcome to my personal domain for the web.
My [thoughts](/blog/thoughts/) are captured on my [Blog](/blog/) where I also save [quotes](/blog/quotes/) from books that feel close to me. For web projects filter on the tech of interest on the blog page. My professional info is gathered in my [Resume](/resume/).

## About Me

In my free time, I like to spend time in our beautiful nature, play golf and make myself a better person day by day. Yoga and mindfulness are of great value in my routine. Right now I try to make our garden (more) bird friendly. I really enjoy spotting them in their habitat.

Starting from 2006 I have collected a lot of electronic music in the form of underground house, garage and uk garage vinyl.
For impressions, you can find me on:

My motto through out the years:

## Freelancing

Outside of my work professionally, I pick up some projects within my social circle under the name **Koeneraad**.
I have been into computers and internet technology since my early childhood. Breaking and building stuff to see how things work was my way of learning. I now use that experience and knowledge I gathered over the years to support the ones that need it. Do you want to work together or have questions? You can reach me by **[email](mailto:info@zweerts.xyz)**.

### Projects

All freelance projects are in my blog tagged with [Koeneraad](/blog/koeneraad).
