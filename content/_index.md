## Hello World

I am a computer and internet technology generalist. I like to learn and develop concepts from new and existing technologies to feed my hunger for tech knowledge. This knowledge I can then apply in my professional carreer as a Software Engineer at Sogeti, _part of Capgemini_.

## Freelancing

Outside of my work professionally, I pick up some projects within my social circle under the name **Koeneraad**.
I have been into computers and internet technology since my early childhood. Breaking and building stuff to see how things work was my way of learning. I now use that experience and knowledge I gathered over the years to support the ones that need it.

My motto through out the years:

> "I have never tried that before, so I think I can do it."
