## As a Professional

I am a passionate full stack developer. Because of my sportive background I accelerate in continuous improvement. For me, the customer is always ‘king’ which to me, makes working in an Agile team feel natural. I am a driven autodidact and schooled myself into a developer.

As far as I can remember, I am a computer and internet technology generalist. I like to learn and develop concepts from new and existing technologies to feed my hunger for tech knowledge. This knowledge I can apply in my professional carreer as a Software Engineer at Sogeti, _part of Capgemini_.

I have a bachelor’s degree in Sports, Health and Management to coach in lifestyle. But I am able to use the concepts of change management and a keen eye for problematics to answer technical issues for the customer.

### Process

I joined the working force as a home schooled script kid that would find his way to a solution by starting and tackeling issues along the way with the help of Google and a healthy discipline to do what ever it takes to get to the end. This has been fun and I learned a great deal about writing code.

**But to write quality software, it takes a whole different level of understanding. _Over a period of 12 months this is exactly what I learned._**
By following a structured Software Development Life Cycle I now have the understanding to deliver software that works, is easy to understand, easy to maintain and easy to test.

Some of the books that helped me understand:
- [Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-object-oriented/0596008678/)
- [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
- [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/classic-design-patterns/)
- [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin)
- [What is Software Quality: Understanding what really matters in software development](https://amzn.eu/d/gcbUtCF)
